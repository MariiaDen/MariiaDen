<p>Hi there! My name is Mariia, and I work as a cyber security consultant by EY. If you ask me what do I do professionally? <span style="color: #333399;"><strong><em>Reducing system errors through bit-sized changes</em></strong></span> - this is my professional, as well as personal purpose I have defined for myself. I like improving things where it's possible, and therefore find my field of work extremely interesting and rewarding.</p>

<p>I am interested in cyber-related topics, especially cloud and DevSecOps. As my hobby activity I learn some new things about AI, since it is a popular topic within cyber world as well. I am actively involved into some Udacity scholarships and courses, as well as teaching children propramming. That's the kind of projects that might pop up here from time to time <img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce4_6_5/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-smile.gif" alt="smile" /></em></strong></span></p>

<p>Sure, this is one of my favorite activities! I have gained my first Microsoft certifications, and have been awarded with 16 EY badges for different topics. You can see some of them here, and even more on Acclaim.</p>
